# JetBrains Mono
A typeface made for developers. \
More about font features & design can be found on [its page](https://jetbrains.com/mono/). 

By default, JetBrains Mono includes ligatures. The version without ligatures is called **JetBrains Mono NL** and can be found [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/tree/master/fonts/ttf). This version is also stripped of all OpenType features, since they don't have any effect when your IDE doesn't support OpenType.

If your IDE supports OpenType we recommend installing the default version of the font. If you prefer not using ligatures you can turn them off manually in the settings. 

# **Installation**

### **In JetBrains IDEs**

The most recent version of JetBrains Mono ships with your JetBrains IDE starting with v2019.3.

Select JetBrains Mono in the IDE settings: go to `Preferences/Settings` → `Editor` → `Font`, and then select JetBrains Mono from the Font dropdown.

### Another IDE or an older version of a JetBrains IDE
#### Through brew (MacOS only)
1. Tap the font cask to make the Jetbrains Mono font available :

    ```console
    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
    ```
2. Install it using the `font-jetbrains-mono` cask:

   ```console
   brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono
   ```
   
#### Through Chocolatey (Windows only)
1. Install Chocolatey if you haven't done already. See [this page](https://chocolatey.org/install) for instructions on how to do that.
2. In an elevated cmd console (Run as administrator...) :

    ```console
    choco install jetbrainsmono
    ```
